# Team Draft: PHP
Simple example script to achieve 'team draft' style of list building from two sorted multi-dimensional arrays

# Inspiration
The original inspiration for this simple script is from this [Netflix Medium Article](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/interleaving-in-online-experiments-at-netflix-a04ee392ec55) discussing new and exciting ways that run split tests simultaneously to quickly validate new test ideas.

This is obviously a 'toy' script that is for demonstration purposes only, but should help developers unfamiliar to the problem quickly port the logic to their language of choice to build a list this way.
